# CLAMP

Automated analysis pipeline for long-read sequencing and an information system to store and present results.
These tools are focused on use in a clinical setting and are currently applied to _BCR-ABL1_ TKI resistance mutation screening for patients undergoing treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia and related diseases.

CLAMP consists of separate parts for sequence data processing (clamp-calc) and informatics (clamp-gui). While designed to work in unison, installation and usage will be explained separately since they are possible installed on separate systmes and used by different people.
