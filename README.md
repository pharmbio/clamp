# CLAMP

Automated analysis pipeline for long-read sequencing and an information system to store and present results.
These tools are focused on use in a clinical setting and are currently applied to _BCR-ABL1_ TKI resistance mutation screening for patients undergoing treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia and related diseases.

CLAMP consists of separate parts for sequence data processing (clamp-calc) and informatics (clamp-gui). While designed to work in unison, installation and usage will be explained separately since they are possibly installed on separate systmes and used by different people.

Data processing:
* [Calc Installation](docs/calc-install.md)
* [Calc Processing](docs/calc-usage.md)
* [Reporting](docs/gui-admin.md)

Results:
* [GUI Installation](docs/gui-install.md)
* [GUI usage](docs/gui-usage.md)
